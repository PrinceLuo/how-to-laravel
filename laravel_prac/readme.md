## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework, making it a breeze to get started learning the framework.

Chapter2
1. An error in migration
Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes......
To solve this, you need to go to app/Providers/AppServiceProvider and modify the the boot() function
(details in the codes, go and check it with the comments I left).

The user auth route (default setting):
vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Support/Facades/Auth.php
vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Routing/Router.php

Before we start Chapter3:
I made a shell script called lampp-laravel.sh to help load Laravel project into lammp automatically.
And notice that when I try loading a image by saying {{ public_path() }}/../tools.png, it fails; however
I succeed by changing it into {{ url('/') }}/../tools.png, permissions problem?

Chapter3
The login page path: views/auth/login.blade.php (same as register)

The navigate bar is written in views/layouts.app.blade.php;

To set the mail function, first you have set the .env file on the mail setting part. Then
go to config/mail.php and set the mail part, just make sure the critical parts are the same 
as the ones in .env file.
